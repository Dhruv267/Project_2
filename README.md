Captain Veggie Game

Description:

For this project we have created the game Captain Veggie, in which rabbits have invaded the good captainâ€™s
field and so the captain must harvest as many of his vegetables as possible before they are consumed by the
leporine menace. In the game, Captain Veggie will move around the field and attempt to harvest
vegetables by moving on top of them. The captain scores points for each vegetable he harvests. At the same
time, the rabbit will randomly hopping about consuming any vegetables they land on. The game will continue until all of the vegetables have been removed from the field, after which the score will be displayed to the screen.

Project Structure:

The project is organized into several classes to handle different aspects of the game:
- FieldInhabitant: Base class for game entities.
- Veggie: Represents vegetable objects in the game.
- Creature: Base class for creatures in the game (Captain and Rabbits).
- Captain: Represents the player-controlled character.
- Rabbit: Represents the enemy creatures.
- GameEngine: Manages the game state, initialization, and game logic.
